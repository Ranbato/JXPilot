               * ShipShaper 1.0 released!




              FEATURES


               * Written in Java. This means it should run on all platforms with a
                 Java virtual machine (at least in theory).
               * Nice, easy to use graphical interface (I hope).
  [Image]      * You can draw ship edges one by one. When saving a ship the program
 Click here      calculated the minimum number of "real" edges needed to create a
to see a big     ship made up of a single polyline.
 screenshoot   * Cut, copy, and paste.
     of        * Operations like moving, splitting, and joining on vertices (ship
 ShipShaper      nodes) and ship edges.
 running in    * Operations like scrolling, rotating and flipping on ships.
    Unix       * Possible to edit ships in two directions. With the nose facing up,
                 and with the nose facing right.



              PLATFORMS

            Since ShipShaper is a 100% pure Java application it should run on every
            platform with a Java virtual machine installed.

            I have not even tried it on the Machintosh (I am too lazy :-) or other
            systems. But it should work in Windows with JDK 1.1.5 or higher.
            This is some kind of a beta version so do not be too surprised if you
            find some bugs. Actually, I have not tested it very much so it is more
            like a alpha version...:-)


              DOWNLOAD

            Download the latest version, v1.0.

            Please read the installation instructions in the next section!


              INSTALL

            I assume you have a working JDK or JRE installation... The JDK (Java
            Developer Kit) is the developer version of Java and the JRE (Java
            Runtime Environment) is a minimal Java installation for running Java
            applications. So if you do not already have the JDK, I recommend that
            you install the JRE. Version 1.1.5 or higher is required.

           * To install, unzip the zip-file with a unzipp:er that can handle long
            file-names. A directory called "ShipShaper" will automatically be
            created so you don't have to create one before unzipping the file.

           * After unzipping the files it can be convinient to create
            script/batch files to run ShipShaper.

            In Windows 95, you can create a batch file similar to this one:

              set CLASSPATH=C:\Apps\ShipShaper\ss.jar
              C:\
              cd \Apps\ShipShaper
              javaw shipshaper.ShipShaper


            The "cd" is needed to make sure that ShipShaper can find its files
            (graphics + config). Does anybody know a better way to do this? There
            must be one...hmm...maybe it is possible to use the new resource stuff
            in JDK1.1+...

            In Unix, you can make a script that looks something like this:

              cd /foo/ShipShaper
              java -classpath /foo/ShipShaper/ss.jar:$CLASSPATH shipshaper.ShipShaper


            Note: You can use javaw (or jrew) if you do not want to see a console
            window...


              NOTES


               * Click on the right mouse button to end drawing operations.
               * The numbers displayed in the Tool panel when the Edge tool is used
                 are the number of "visible" edges, and the number of "true" edges
                 respectively. For example, "13 (15)" means you have used 13 edges,
                 but 15 is required to make a "draw the whole figure without lifting
                 the pen" ship.
               * To be able to load the ship in XPilot it must be fully connected (no
                 "islands"). The number of "true" edges will be displayed as "(-)" if
                 it is not connected. It is possible to save the ship in that
                 situation, but only ShipShaper will be able to load it.
               * You can use your XPilot configuration file (xpilotrc) for
   [Image]       loading/saving ships in addition to "stand-alone" shipshape files.
                 But take backup copies of your xpilotrc before trying to use it with
                 ShipShaper beacause this function has not been tested very much...
                 :-)
               * The preferences are saved in a file called ss.cfg in the directory
                 you started ShipShaper from. So make sure you start ShipShaper from
                 the ShipShaper directory (for example by using scripts like the ones
                 in the INSTALL section).
               * If you hold the mouse pointer over a miniature ship view the ship
                 starts to rotate!



              CHANGES


            Version 1.0 (1998-06-01)

               * Made a workaround for the Unix dialog bug. I found out that
                 non-resizable dialogs doesn't work on Unix system. So if you are
                 running ShipShaper on a Unix system the dialogs will be resizable.

            Version 0.91 (1998-02-01)

               * Fixed some ship definition string parsing errors (not real errors
                 actually, now the parser is more forgiving to errors in the
                 definition string). Also improved the parsing error messages.
               * Fixed a bug which caused the ship to appear mirrored. Stupid me.
               * Added a "mirror marker".
               * Some minor improvements.

            Version 0.9 (1998-01-26)

               * The first released version. Full with bugs! :-)



              KNOWN BUGS & PROBLEMS


               * Only works properly in Windows (due to AWT errors) [Fixed in 1.0].
               * When loading big (huge) shipshape files it is easy to run out of
                 memory.
               * Get parsing errors when parsing ships which are not following the
   [Image]       "specification" exactly. [Fixed in v0.91]
               * The ship equipment (guns, lights, etc.) appears to be "mirrored"
                 [Fixed in v0.91]

              A SHORT STORY

            I started working on ShipShaper in 1996 because I wanted to learn some
            Java. I also wanted to do something "real", and I decided to do this
            editor for my favourite game XPilot!

            In a few weeks I had something that looked like an editor but had a lot
            of problems to get rid of all bugs (actually, later on I found out that
            many of them was in Java itself). So I got tired of it and did not touch
            it for two years... :-)

            Ok, two years later with more Java skills, I rewrote the whole program.
            Now it was almost, almost finished. Actually, it worked almost perfectly
            (for beeing a beta) on Windows 95, but not on Unix. "Write once, run
            everywhere" Hmm... :-) I even a description plus snapshots on my XPilot
            homepage. I could have released it but did not because I wanted to fix
            the Unix bugs first. And the Winddows 95 version had a nasty AWT bug to.
            But I had my hands full with other things and forgot about it....:-)

            Later (in 1998), when developing another Java application, I found that
            the (mostly AWT related) problems I had with ShipShaper was gone in newer
            versions of the Java JDK. So, I recompiled ShipShaper with the new JDK
            and it worked! At least on Windows 95....

            Now you know what happened to the "almost" finished ShipShaper I talked
            with some people about earlier... Hehe... :-)

            I am not sure if I want to spend any more time on developing this program
            any more, but I can at least fix any major bugs that turns up (and
            hopefully get the Unix version working).
