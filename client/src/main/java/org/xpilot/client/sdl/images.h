 * different states. If rotate flag is true, the image will be rotated
 * when it is created to generate num_frames-1 of new frames.
 * Width is the cumulative width of all frames. Frame_width is the width
 * of any single frame. Because OpenGL requires the dimensions of the images
 * to be powers of 2, data_width and data_height are the nearest powers of 2
 * corresponding to width and height respectively.
